# javascript-challenge
My friends at ALIENS-R-REAL have complied an extensive database of eye-witness accounts of extra-terrestrials here on planet Earth. To help them get credible information out to the masses, they hired me to create a searchable table of their data that is accessible by the general public. For this project I used the provided starter code with a basic HTML page (index.html) and data source (data.js) and then wrote JavaScript code that filters the data based on user input. The code contained in UFO-level-1 allows the user to filter the data-set by date only, however, UFO-level-2 allows the user to filter the data-set by date, country, state, city, and shape of the UFO.
